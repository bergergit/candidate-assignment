# Pinger Take Home assignment

Hello!

This is FÃ¡bio Berger and this is my implementation of Pinger's take home assignment.

I've attached a video below, showcasing the implementtion.

The project was built with Ionic 6 with Angular 13.

## To run the project in the browser

Run `ionic serve` and open the browser on `http://localhost:8100/`. 

## To run the project on a device

Run `npm run build` to build the project, and run `npx cap sync` to let Capacitor Sync all the changes.

Then run `npx cap open ios` or `npx cap open android` to open XCode / Android Studio, and run the app from there.

## Unit tests

I've implemented some Unit Tests. You can run them with `npm test`

## E2E tests

I've also implemented a couple of tests using Protractor. It's testing the main competition list page.

Run them with `npm run e2e`
